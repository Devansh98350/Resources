            <strong>UNIT 20: PRINCIPLES RELATED TO PRACTICAL CHEMISTRY:</strong>
            <br />• Detection of extra elements (Nitrogen, Sulphur, halogens) in
            organic compounds; Detection of the following functional groups;
            hydroxyl (alcoholic and phenolic), carbonyl (aldehyde and ketones)
            carboxyl, and amino groups in organic compounds. <br />
            •The chemistry involved in the preparation of the following: <br />
            Inorganic compounds; Mohr’s salt, potash alum. <br /> Organic
            compounds: Acetanilide, p-nitro acetanilide, aniline yellow,
            iodoform.
            <br />• The chemistry involved in the titrimetric exercises – Acids,
            bases, and the use of indicators, oxalic-acid vs KMnO4, Mohr’s salt
            vs KMnO4 <br />• Chemical principles involved in the qualitative
            salt analysis: <br />
            Cations – Pb2+, Cu2+, Al3+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+ , NH4
            + <br />
            Anions- CO3 2−, S 2- ,SO4 2−, NO3- , NO2- , Cl- , Br- , I- (
            Insoluble salts excluded). <br />
            Chemical principles involved in the following experiments:
            <br /> 1. Enthalpy of solution of CuSO4 <br />
            2. Enthalpy of neutralization of strong acid and strong base. <br />
            3. Preparation of lyophilic and lyophobic sols. <br />
            4. Kinetic study of the reaction of iodide ions with hydrogen
            peroxide at room temperature.
