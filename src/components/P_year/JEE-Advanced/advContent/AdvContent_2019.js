            JEE Advanced 2019 Paper Analysis
          </h1>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            The JEE Advanced 2019 was held on May 27th. The test was led by IIT
            Roorkee and around 1.70 lakh applicants showed up for the test.
            Paper 1 was led toward the beginning of the day shift from 9:00 am
            to 12:00 pm while paper 2 was led from 2:00 to 4:00 pm. The exam
            pattern was like 2018. In any case, since tests have finished up
            students can look at the paper examination on how the inquiry paper
            was set, its trouble level and different subtleties.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Subject specialists at IIT Academy have completely investigated and
            given definite paper-wise and subjectwise examinations of the JEE
            Advanced inquiry papers. The paper, by and large, was somewhat
            harder contrasted with last year (2018).
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Paper-1: </strong> The general trouble of paper 1 was
            moderate. Not surprisingly, Maths was on the troublesome side while
            material science was on a moderate level. Chemistry was the simplest
            segment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            <strong>Paper-2: </strong> Paper 2 was relatively simpler than paper
            1. In this paper, the math-related segment was somewhat extreme and
            extended, physics was extended additionally while chemistry was once
            more the simplest area.
