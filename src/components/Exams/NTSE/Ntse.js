          <p>
            The result of NTSE stage 2 exam will be processed in the online mode
            only and NCERT makes sure that there is no discrepancy in processing
            the results. Therefore, NCERT will not consider any request for
            re-checking/re-evaluating the results, if any candidate raises an
            objection to the scoring.
