          <h1>JEE Main Results</h1>
          <p>
            The National Testing Agency is responsible for declaring the results
            of JEE Main. In the case of students who choose to appear in all the
            phases of JEE Main, the best result would be taken into
            consideration while preparing for the final rank.
          </p>
          <h3>How to Check JEE Main Results?</h3>
          <p>
            In order to check the JEE Main result, follow the steps given below:
          </p>
          <p>First, open JEE Main result portal</p>
          <p>Second, enter the roll number and the date of birth</p>
          <p>Third, click on the submit button</p>
          <p>
            By following these steps the JEE Main result will be displayed on
            the screen. To ease the counseling and admission process the student
            should always have their scorecard.
          </p>
          <h1>JEE Main Cutoff Marks</h1>
          <p>
            Along with the detailed result consisting of subject-wise marks
            scored, All India Rank, category rank, and the qualifying status for
            JEE Advanced, the National Testing Agency also declares JEE Main
            cutoff marks after the completion of the exam.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, candidates are shortlisted for counseling based on the
            percentile score.
          </p>
          <p>Below given factors determine the cut-off marks for JEE Main:</p>

            IIIT Delhi are technical institutes excluded from JoSAA counseling.
            But in the case of these institutes, the admission is based on JEE

            separately.

          <h1>Importance of NCERT Books for JEE Main 2025</h1>
          <p>
            There are students who don't prefer investing time in the NCERT book
            for JEE Main preparation. NCERT is indeed essential for cracking JEE
            Main. NCERT is the textbook that helps the candidates have a firm
            grasp on all the fundamental concepts of the subjects that are a
            part of the JEE Main syllabus. Let's have a look at why the NCERT
            curriculum is necessary for cracking JEE Main:
          </p>
          <h4>JEE Main Chemistry:</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most helpful resources for JEE's main preparation is the
            NCERT Chemistry textbook. There are many questions for organic and
            inorganic chemistry directly picked from the textbook. Hence the
            aspirants are recommended to go through the JEE Main NCERT Chemistry
            textbook and practice all the question papers, mock tests, and
            exercises.
          </p>
          <h4>JEE Main Maths:</h4>
          <p>
            The math section is considered the toughest in the entire exam. The
            candidates need to have more study materials to master all the
            concepts of this subject. Completing the NCERT math textbook should
            be the first goal as it consists of numerous explanations and
            exercises that boost the student's analytical and problem-solving
            skills.
          </p>
          <h4>JEE Main Physics:</h4>
          <p>
            The physics section is a bit tricky. The entire NCERT physics should
            be covered so that it becomes easy for the candidates to understand
            the wider concept from the other reference books.
          </p>
          <p>
