            <li>
              <b>Stay Consistent : </b>Develop a routine that includes daily
              practice. Consistency enhances learning outcomes and boosts
              confidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Seek Guidance When Needed : </b>If certain concepts are
              challenging, don't hesitate to ask teachers or join an English
              coaching program that aligns with the IEO syllabus.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
