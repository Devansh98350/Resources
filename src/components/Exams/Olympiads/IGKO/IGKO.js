          <h1>What is IGKO ? </h1>
          <p>
            The SOF International General Knowledge Olympiad (IGKO) is a
            prestigious competitive exam conducted by the Science Olympiad
            Foundation (SOF). Designed to enhance students' awareness of current
            affairs, general knowledge, and life skills, IGKO encourages young
            minds to stay informed and develop a strong understanding of the
            world around them. This exam caters to students from Class 1 to
            Class 10 and is held annually across schools worldwide. Unlike
            subject-specific Olympiads, the IGKO focuses on assessing a
            student's knowledge in diverse areas such as general awareness,
            environmental issues, sports, history, geography, and current
            events.
            <br></br>
            The IGKO not only evaluates memory and factual knowledge but also
            emphasizes analytical thinking, decision-making, and real-world
            awareness. By participating in this Olympiad, students can sharpen
            their critical thinking skills while staying updated with national
            and global developments. The IGKO is an ideal platform for students
            seeking to improve their communication skills, cognitive abilities,
            and general knowledge, fostering well-rounded development that
            proves beneficial in academics and beyond. In addition to earning
            certificates, medals, and cash prizes, participants gain valuable
            exposure to competitive exam formats at an early stage, preparing
            them for future challenges with confidence.

              expression and boost your performance in descriptive questions.

            <li>
              <b>Maintain a Balanced Routine : </b>Prioritize sufficient rest, a
              nutritious diet, and regular physical exercise to keep your mind
              sharp and focused.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Avoid Last-Minute Cramming : </b>Consistent revision is key to
              retaining information effectively.
