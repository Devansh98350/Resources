          <h1>WHAT IS IPHO?</h1>
          <p>
            The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is one of the most
            prestigious physics competitions in the world, designed to inspire
            young minds and recognize the intellectual prowess of high school
            students. Founded in 1967 by Poland, it has grown to become a symbol
            of academic excellence and an event fostering international
            collaboration. Each year, the competition brings together the
            brightest physics students from around the globe to test their
            theoretical and experimental knowledge, providing a platform to
            encourage curiosity and innovation in the field of physics. The
            competition not only evaluates the participants' problem-solving
            skills and experimental abilities but also aims to cultivate a
            spirit of friendship and cultural exchange among young physicists.
            Over time, it has played a pivotal role in shaping the careers of
            many who have gone on to excel in physics and related fields.

                <b>Initial Qualification:</b> Students must first participate in
                their country’s national physics olympiad or selection exam.
                This process typically involves rigorous theoretical and
                practical tests to identify the most talented high school
                students.

            and practical aspects of Physics. Students sit for the theoretical
            exam, which comprises objective questions. Subsequently, in the
            second phase, students engage in the practical segment of the
            examination.
