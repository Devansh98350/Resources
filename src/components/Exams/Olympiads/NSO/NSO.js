          <h1>What is NSO?</h1>
          <p>
            The National Science Olympiad (NSO), conducted by the Science
            Olympiad Foundation (SOF), is an esteemed and globally recognized
            competition that aims to ignite curiosity and foster a deeper
            understanding of science among students from Class 1 to Class 12.
            This prestigious exam challenges students to explore the wonders of
            the scientific world through stimulating problem-solving and
            critical thinking exercises, while also testing their knowledge
            across multiple scientific disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry,
            Biology, Environmental Science, and General Science. More than just
            a test of academic knowledge, the Science Olympiad fosters a spirit
            of intellectual curiosity and a love for science by encouraging
            students to delve beyond their textbooks and think analytically.
            Through this examination, students gain the opportunity to
            strengthen their problem-solving skills, enhance their scientific
            reasoning, and develop a comprehensive understanding of complex
            concepts that are essential for future academic success.
