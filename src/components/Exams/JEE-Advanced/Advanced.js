          <h1>JEE Advanced 2025 Syllabus</h1>
          <p>
            The syllabus of JEE Advanced is declared by the Examination
            Authority. As compared to the previous years' JEE Advanced 2025
            syllabus has been released with some differences. The syllabus is
            extracted according to the NCERT curriculum and is somewhat very
            similar to the Main syllabus. The difference that can be spotted is
            in the weightage of the different topics. The students should have
            an update regarding the syllabus so that they can schedule their
            preparation accordingly. To check the subject-wise syllabus for JEE
            Advanced the candidate can follow the link given below:
          </p>
          <div className="listdata">
            <ul>
              <li>JEE Advanced Physics Syllabus</li>

              <li>JEE Advanced Math Syllabus</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            The objective of the questions in the JEE Advanced paper is to test
            conceptual clarity and application-based knowledge hence, the
            candidates are suggested to practice mixed variations of problems
            from different reference books. It is highly important to invest
            time in all three subjects equally. The questions can pop up from
            anywhere, all the aspirants should have a suitable study plan based
            on the topics that are included in the syllabus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Books play a vital role in taking candidates closer to their goals.
            It is very important to pick the right books for IIT preparation.
            The quality of work matters over the number of books. To avoid
            confusion between the concepts, multiple books should not be
            referred to study similar topics. All the aspirants should analyze
            their strengths and weaknesses to draft an appropriate study plan so
            that the preparation can be completed on time and there is enough
            time left for revision.
          </p>
          <h1>JEE Advanced 2025 Preparation Tips</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Focus:</b> Your focus will decide your selection. It is better to
            understand the concept rather than just focusing on formulae.
            Through this process, one can know the entire method used to get to
            the formula. Hence, you will be able to memorize formulae easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Organize your time:</b> Proper time management during preparation
            is important. Keep track of the time duration you take to solve
            questions. Also, allocating time subject-wise will help you attempt
            the JEE Advanced paper within the given time constraint. This will

            JoSAA.
